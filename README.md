# Working Application
https://codepen.io/mookh01/full/gGWBOQ/
# Objective

User Story: I can view a heat map with data represented both on the Y and X axis.

User Story: Each cell is colored based its relationship to other data.

User Story: I can mouse over a cell in the heat map to get more exact information.

# Challenges
Navigating the D3 documentation continues to be difficult. I've just taken my time to try and understand what the syntax is doing to get a better understanding.
Parsing the data correctly remains my biggest difficulty. In this case it was using  `new Date( )` and allowing this built in javascript parse years and months. Other challenges is lining up the scales and axis but through playing with the x & y I was able to make them line up.
